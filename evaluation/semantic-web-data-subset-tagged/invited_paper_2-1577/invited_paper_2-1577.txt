Abstract. Graph-structured data, which are receiving increased attention in the database community, are tightly connected to Description
Logics (DLs), given that these two formalims share the underlying interpretation structures. In this talk, we consider the challenging setting
of graph-structured data that evolve as a result of update operations
adding and deleting facts in the style of action languages, under constraints capturing domain knowledge. We argue that expressive variants
of DLs provide indeed quite powerful mechanisms for expressing forms of
constraints over graph-structured data, and we draw interesting connections to path-constraints studied in databases. In this setting we discuss
two fundamental reasoning tasks, considering both lightweight and expressive variants of DLs: verification, i.e., checking the consistency of a
sequence of operations with respect to constraints; and plan existence,
i.e., existence of a sequence of operations leading to a goal state.
