Abstract There is a striking increase in the availability of statistical data
in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud, and the Cube vocabulary has
become the de facto standard for the description of multi-dimensional
data. However, the reuse of a standard vocabulary needs to pair with
modeling strategies that make it easy to locate, consume and integrate
information. In this paper, we developed a quantitative study on how
the main concepts of the Cube vocabulary are applied in practice, using
the governmental datasets identified in the 2014 LOD cloud census. Our
focus was on the commonly used strategies for multi-dimensional modeling
using Cube because they have an impact on the automatic location and
consumption of data. The results provide feedback to work that addresses
Cube usage and establish a baseline for evolution comparison.

Introduction

Statistical data is used as the foundation for policy prediction, planning and
adjustments. There is a growing consensus that the Linked Open Data (LOD)
cloud is the right platform for creating, locating and integrating heterogeneous and
distributed open datasets for a myriad of analysis purposes [3,4,7,9,10]. However,
the LOD cloud as a primary source for integrated data can only scale if there is a
strong commitment to its basic principles in terms of vocabulary reuse, linking and
metadata provision. A study that compared several vocabulary reuse strategies [12]
concluded that practitioners favor the reuse of a single, popular vocabulary.
The Cube vocabulary [11] is a W3C recommendation for publishing multidimensional data in the web. It establishes that datasets contain observations about
measures, according to one or more dimensions. A data definition structure (DSD)
explicitly describes the structure and semantics of the observations in a dataset.
Although not restricted to statistical data, it was designed to be compatible with
statistical ISO SDMX standard. The last LOD census [13] revealed that the Cube
vocabulary was adopted in 61.75% of the datasets in the government government domain, and several projects focus on infrastructure for using, publishing,
validating and visualizing cube datasets [5,7,9,8].
However, the reuse of a standard vocabulary needs to pair with modeling
strategies that make it easy to locate, consume and integrate information in the

2

LOD cloud. The use of the Cube vocabulary is complex, as it involves mastering
both the multidimensional modeling paradigm, and the vocabulary itself. As a
result, cube datasets available in the LOD cloud are very diverse [3,4,9,10]. Cube
publishing platforms [5,7,9] are targeted at the correct and complete usage of the
vocabulary, but until a thorough discussion on the best patterns is developed,
publishers lack methodological support for making modeling decisions that influence
how easily cube datasets can be located in the LOD cloud and consumed.
In this paper, we present a quantitative survey on the usage of the Cube
vocabulary considering governmental datasets identified in the last LOD census.
The survey focuses on the commonly used strategies for modeling multi-dimensional
data according to the Cube, because they affect how data can be found and
consumed automatically. Among the results, we found that: a) many cube datasets
are not well-formed (e.g. 35% of DSDs do not define measures correctly); b) despite
many dimensions represent the exact same concept and values (e.g. Year), they are
seldomly reused across different organizations, are defined using the same domain
or are inter-linked; c) there is a strong influence of SDMX modeling, but which is
not adequately captured using Cube constructs; etc. The analysis is reproducible,
and datasets/procedures are available in a public repository.
The main contributions of this survey are: a) it provides a detailed analysis
of various ways Cube vocabulary is used in practice and guidance on the most
useful representations, and b) it serves as a baseline for comparison with the
evolution of Cube usage. Cube is a recent W3C recommendation, and its usage
will evolve as more examples are available, the trade-offs of each modeling choice
are better understood from different perspectives (i.e. publisher, consumer), and
comprehensive and innovative supporting platforms become available. The results
are also relevant to all works addressing Cube usage (e.g. methodological support,
supporting platforms [5,7,9], cube discovery [2])
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the key terms
of the Cube vocabulary. Section 3 discusses the trade-offs of the most common
modeling strategies for modeling measures as Cube multi-dimensional data. Section
4 describes the GQM analysis framework, and discusses the results. Section 5
discusses related work, and Section 6 draws conclusions.

Cube Vocabulary

The key terms of the Cube vocabulary are depicted in Fig. 1, adapted from the
specification [11]. A DSD (qb:DataStructureDefinition) defines the structure of a
dataset. A dataset (qb:DataSet) must be linked to one (and only one) DSD, and each
observation (qb:Observation) to one (and only one) dataset. Observations provide
values to the dimensions, measures and attributes, according the corresponding
DSD. Integrity constraints define rules for well-formed cubes.
Much of the information in a DSD is implicit within the observations, but its
explicit declaration has several benefits [11]: a) verification that a dataset matches
an expected structure; b) reuse in the publication process; c) simplification and
confidence for data consumption; among others.
A DSD aggregates components (qb:ComponentSpecification), which in turn
reference properties. A qb:ComponentProperty is an abstract class that encapsulates orthogonal pieces of information, namely: a) the nature of the component

Figure 1: Cube key terms and relationships
(subclasses qb:DimensionProperty, qb:MeasureProperty and qb:AttributeProperty);
b) the concept being represented (qb:concept); and c) the type of its values. The
type can be defined through rdfs:range, mandatory in the case of dimensions, or
through a qb:codeList connected to one of the classes depicted in Fig. 1. Common
statistical concepts and associated code lists used across statistical datasets are
defined by the SDMX standard as a set of content oriented guidelines (COG), for
which corresponding RDF encodings were created. They are not part of the Cube
specification, but in practice, they are widely used.
A DSD defines at least one measure. Two approaches are available for multiple measures [11], illustrated in Fig. 2: a) multi-measure (ST2) and b) measure
dimension (ST3). In the former, typical in Business Intelligence and OLAP applications, each observation contains values for each measure defined in the DSD.
The second approach is derived from the SDMX information model. To use this
representation, the DSD also specifies different measures, and an implicit dimension (qb:measureType) plays the role of the "measure dimension". The dataset can
contain different measures, but each observation is related to a single measured
value, according to the value of the measure dimension.

Modeling Strategies

Cube provides a standard vocabulary, with degrees of freedom that result in
different styles of multidimensional modeling, possibly influenced by diverse backgrounds. Let us consider two examples from the peace-building domain. FAO1
collects and publishes open data on food security, which involves 21 indicators
about health, transportation, economics, etc. FFP2 defines a Fragile State Index
(FSI), which ranks the vulnerability of countries according to 14 social, economical
and political indicators. These are annual indicators that refer to a specific country.
FSI indicators are consistently collected, but food security data is quite sparse.
Fig. 2 shows DSD excerpts according to 3 modeling options: single-measure
(ST1), multi-measure (ST2) and measure dimension (ST3). For FSI, all strategies
are valid. For food security, strategy ST2 is not valid because measures cannot
be optional in well-formed cubes. According to ST1, there will be one DSD per
indicator. The use of ST2 or ST3 will result in DSDs that contain several measures.
Fig. 2 also shows excerpts for measure and dimension properties. The dimension
fao:refArea represents the location, as indicated by the related concept (smdxconcept:refArea). Two reuse strategies are exemplified involving time dimension
(fao:refPeriod). First, it is defined as a sub-property of sdmx-dimension:refPeriod,

which in turn is related to the SDMX time period concept. It also adds the property
range. Second, FSI DSDs reuse fao:refPeriod dimension "as-is".
Fig. 3 illustrates two additional modeling patterns3 , frequently adopted when
SDMX descriptions are automatically converted (e.g. [4]). Compared to ST1 in
Fig. 2, there are some subtle differences. First, the measure is generic in both cases
(sdmx:obsValue), corresponding to a statistical concept valid in any domain. In the
case of fao:CaptureDSD (ST4), the conceptual context is provided by the DSD
title ("Capture Fisheries"). In the case of wb:indicatorsDSD (ST5), the dimension
wb:indicator is meant to represent the specific measure in an observation (a "measure
dimension"), where an associated codelist describes the possible measures. In that
case, the conceptual context is partially provided by the codelist, but only the
presence of a code within a dataset provides information for the available measures.
Although strategies ST4 and ST5 result in correct and well-formed cubes,
they do not benefit from constructs designed to represent a measure dimension
(qb:measureType). Standard vocabulary and standard usage of vocabulary increase
the ability to find, understand and consume data automatically in the LOD.
In terms of semantic expressiveness, ST1-ST3 are the most expressive ones in
that the most relevant information needed to identify, understand, and consume
datasets is explicit in the DSD. Additionally, measures and dimensions can be
associated to both domain and statistical concepts, such that interlinking and
inferences can be done automatically. The other two modeling strategies imply

discovering in an ad hoc manner which constructs hide the intended semantics
(e.g. a DSD/dataset label or description). fao:captureDSD can virtually represent
any measure indexed by time and location. wb:indicatorDSD aims at representing
the ST3 strategy, but without the appropriate constructs. If one is searching for
datasets that contain demographic pressure measures, the answer is straightforward
by querying the DSDs of Fig. 2. For the other ones, the DSD provides limited
explicit information: it would require identifying that a dimension has a particular
role (the measure dimension), finding in the respective codelist if one of the codes
represents the desired measure, and locating the relevant datasets by searching
the observations that contain that code. Building generic applications to consume
data would have to deal with all these issues.
Strategies ST1-ST3 also make it easy to verify if datasets are conformant
with regard to the respective DSD. ST4 provides no means for verifying such
conformance. In ST5, that capacity is limited: the codelist can be used, but a
change on the codelist itself, without concerns for retro-compatibility, can affect
the meaning of a DSD, and possibly impact existing consumers. For instance, the
removal of a code from the codelist would change the semantics of the DSD, but
it will be harder to notice such a change compared to the removal of a measure.

Quantitative Analysis

This survey aims at quantifying the usage of the Cube vocabulary in terms of
practices concerning the Data Structure Definition (DSD), reuse of dimensions and
measures, and conceptual annotation. The evaluation of the current usage provides
feedback to other works (e.g. discussion on the best practices, methodological
support, Cube supporting platforms, cube discovery), as well as establish a baseline
for comparing with usage evolution. The quantitative analysis is reproducible,
since all datasets used, extraction procedures, and queries used to compute the
metrics are available in a public repository4 .
4.1

Scope

The analysis framework was defined according to the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM)
approach [1], which defines a measurement model at three levels. The conceptual
level is represented by the Goal of the measurement, stated in terms of five
components: entity, purpose, focus, point of view and context. The second level
is operational, where a set of Questions define models of the object of study, in
order to characterize the assessment or achievement of a specific goal. Finally, the
quantitative level, defines a set of Measures that enable to answer the questions in
a measurable way. We defined three goals for this survey:
‚Äì Goal 1: Analyze DSD and Datasets for the purpose of understanding
with respect to DSD relevance and reuse from the point of view of
the publisher in the context of the LOD cloud. Defining a DSD for each
dataset is a basic rule for well-formed cubes, and benefits are claimed with
regard to DSD explicit information [11], such as discoverability, conformance
checking, and reuse. We aim at verifying whether publishers do agree with
these benefits, by declaring and reusing DSDs or DSD properties.

‚Äì Goal 2: Analyze DSD for the purpose of understanding with respect
to modeling strategy from the point of view of the publisher in the
context of the LOD cloud. The way measures and dimensions are explicitly
and implicitly declared in the DSD influences the discoverability, understanding
and processing of cube datasets, as discussed in Section 3. We aim at discovering
how frequent is each modeling strategy, and how easy it is to identify hidden
semantics about measures and dimensions.
‚Äì Goal 3: Analyze DSD for the purpose of understanding with respect
to DSD conceptual enrichment from the point of view of the publisher in the context of the LOD cloud. Semantics are added to DSD
properties through relationships to concepts. We aim at verifying whether
publishers practice semantic annotation.
4.2

Operations

Context Selection. We selected the LOD cloud as reported by the Mannheim
Catalogue5 , because it contains the most recent compilation of Linked Datasets
(Aug. 2014), and it encompasses all entries from Datahub.io Catalogue6 . Relevant
entries were identified using tags format-cube.
Questions and Metrics. Questions and respective metrics are summarized
in Table 1. Names of the metrics are self-describing, where direct metrics are
represented by absolute numbers, and indirect metrics, by percentages. For example,
M1 is the number of datasets (nbDatasets), M2 is the number of datasets with a
related DSD (nbDatasetsWithDSD), and M2% refers to the proportion M2/M1.
With regard to Goal 1, our expectation is that all datasets are related to
a DSD, as it is a basic rule in well-formed cubes. Two types of reuse are considered. NbReusedDSDs corresponds to DSDs related to more than one dataset
(M6). Similarly, reused dimensions/measures in DSD (M7 and M8) concern dimension/measure properties used in more than one DSD description. We also examine
the reuse through the definition of new dimensions/measures as sub-properties
of existing ones (M9 and M10). Metrics M11 and M12 aim to reveal the most
reused dimensions/measure properties, regardless the method. Both types of reuse
demonstrate the interest in defining standards for widely used properties present
in statistical datasets (e.g. temporal and geographical dimensions).
The metrics for Goal 2 aim at quantifying each modeling strategy described in
Section 3. Metrics M13-15 are focused on strategies ST2, ST3 and ST1, respectively.
M16 evaluates DSDs with a single generic measure (ST4 or ST5). M17 measures
the use of strategy ST5, which is hard to identify with precision, and we searched
for different patterns to identify this situation (M18).
The metrics concerning Goal 3 focus on determining whether component properties (dimensions and/or measures) are qualified by concepts (M19-22), and to
which extent these are standard SDMX concepts (M23-25). Metrics M26 and M27
study DSDs that include at least one component property qualified by a concept,
and M28 reveals the most frequent concepts used.

Data Collection Procedures. Data was collected through the months of March
and April 2015. We developed crawlers to extract the entries from the Mannheim
Catalogue, resulting in 114 entries. Then, we created a local repository to integrate
DSD descriptive data extracted from all the entries that were operational 7 . We
queried for resources of all the classes depicted in Fig. 1, except for qb:Observation.
We were also concerned by resources related to the cube properties, as well as
properties from other vocabularies (e.g. rdfs:subPropertyOf, rdfs:range). For this
purpose, we developed a program that iterates through a set of Sparql endpoints,
issues a set of queries that select and constructs the resources and properties of
interest as triples, and save the results in a repository (Open RDF). As a result,
we extracted data about 16,563 datasets and 6,847 DSDs.
Measuring Operations. We developed Sparql queries to collect each one of
the direct metrics in Table 1, and the indirect measures were derived using
a spreadsheet, according to the corresponding formulae. Considering the large
dominance of a single publisher (Linked Eurostat, with 6,539 DSDs), we decided
to run our measuring queries considering three scenarios: a) all non-Eurostat data;
Linked Eurostat data only; and combined data. In this way, in the analysis of the

results and practices per publisher8 could be identified based on the URIs. We run
additional queries to investigate the accuracy of the numbers, the hidden patterns,
and the usual practices.
4.3

Analysis and Interpretation

The raw values for each one of the indirect and direct metrics in Table 1 are
presented in Table 2, and discussed in the remaining of this section.
Goal 1. Most datasets are defined by a DSD (M2%=98.3%), with 273 exceptions.
Two publishers, responsible for 263 and 10 datasets, respectively, do not adopt
this practice at all. DSDs are not often reused (M4=12), a practice identified only
for three publishers. One of the DSDs, which follows the modeling strategy ST5,
is reused 9,416 times, probably according to the different values of the dimension
representing a measure. Otherwise, reused DSDs are related to 2-4 datasets.
Regarding the reuse of dimensions and measures, two patterns can be found:
reuse inside the scope of a same publisher, as part of the definitions that are
consistently adopted, or reuse of SDMX standards. Although most publishers have
dimensions representing the same real world of entity (e.g. countries, years), they
all define their in-house representation for them. Linkage was found just at instance
level (e.g. geographical entities). Both dimensions (M7%=61.1%) and measures
(M8%=19.6%) were reused in DSDs. Linked Eurostat adopts this practice more
consistently: it adopts generic sdmx-measure:obsValue as measure (strategies ST4
8

The term publisher refers to the entity to which the data refers to, such as FAO, FMI,
Eurostat, etc., and not necessarily the organization, possibly a third party, which
actually published the data in the LOD cloud.

or ST5), and reuses consistently the same in-house dimension definitions across
all datasets, with the exception of sdmx-dimension:freq and dcterms:time, used in
100% of the DSDs. SDMX dimensions and measures are reused as super property
of other dimensions (M9=4) and measures (M10=1), particularly obsValue (193),
refArea (20) and refPeriod (15). Among the top 5 reused dimensions (M11), two
are generic (sdmx-dimension:freq and dcterms:time), used 6,476 times each only in
Eurostat. The other three ones are in-house representations for location, measure
unit, and sex. Outside Eurostat, the popular dimensions are publisher dependent
representations for Time, Time period, and location, where just two of them are
defined as sub-property of the respective SDMX dimension. The top 5 reused
measures (M12) are sdmx:obsValue (6,539) and its variations according to the
publishers (all defined as sub-property of sdmx:obsValue).
Goal 2. Strategies ST1 (M15) and ST3 (M14) are not adopted at all, and ST2 is
rarely adopted ( (M13%=17.5% referring two non-Eurostat publishers). Every time
a DSD presented a single measure, it was a generic one (sdmx-measure:obsValue or
publisher-dependent variations) (M16$=99.1%). To distinguish between ST1 and
ST4/ST5 in non-Eurostat DSDs, we selected all DSDs defining a single measure
(244). From these, we filtered the ones involving combinations of the strings ‚Äôobs‚Äô
and ‚Äôvalue‚Äô in the URI, which resulted in the exact same set. To confirm, we
manually inspected 50 of these measure properties and confirmed that labels,
descriptions or concepts conveyed no specific domain information. The numbers
referring to DSDs following strategy ST5 (M17%=33.1%) may not be accurate
due to the difficulty in identifying dimensions representing indicators in a reliable
manner. We also found 11 DSDs related to a same publisher without any measure.
To identify indicator dimensions (M18), we searched for patterns involving
concepts, codelists and URI rules. Labels involving the string ‚Äôindicator‚Äô sometimes
would reveal such type of dimension, but the most encompassing strategy involved
merely URI patterns. The best substrings were ‚Äôindic‚Äô, ‚Äôvariab‚Äô and ‚Äômeasure‚Äô. For
Eurostat, 36 dimensions were identified in this way, and for other 6 publishers, 13.
We obtained 100% of precision with the first two substrings, and 58% with the
latter. In all cases, the error referred to a dimension representing a unit of measure
(an attribute in Cube), rather than a measure. We also examined randomly 70 other
dimensions that did not follow this pattern, and none of them was an indicator
dimension, which could be considered as 100% of recall.
Goal 3. Most dimensions are related to concepts (M21%=86.3%), but measures
are not (M22%=9.8%). However, most concepts are also internal to the publisher,
normally paired with the codelists defined for the dimensions. This could be
easily verified by pairing the URIs, and verifying their formation patterns. When
measuring the number of dimensions/measures related specifically to SDMX
concepts, we noticed that the figures were exactly the same. A manual inspection
revealed the common practice of defining a concept as an instance of sdmx:Concept,
which is not adequate considering SDMX is a standard to be shared across datasets
of various domains. To measure linkage with SDMX concepts, we adopted the
following definitions: a concept that belongs to the standard SDMX COG, an
SDMX dimension/measure (which is always associated to a SDMX concept), or
a dimension/measure defined as sub-property of an SDMX dimension/measure.
According to this more strict interpretation, the number of component properties

10

Karin Becker, Shiva Jahangiri, and Craig A. Knoblock

related to the SDMX standard was limited (M24%=3.5% and M25%4.9%). DSDs
were considered related to (SDMX) concepts if at least one dimension/measure
was, which explains the high figures for M26 and M27.
The top 5 concepts used in DSDs were sdmx-concept:obsValue, sdmx-concept:freq,
and three concepts within the domain of Eurostat representing location, measuring unit and sex. Among non-Eurostat publishers, the top concepts were
sdmx-concept:obsValue, and distinct representations for time period, location and
frequency. We also examined the range of dimensions in the search for conceptual
clues, but mostly they are defined merely as generic skos:Concept (100% in case
of Eurostat), or publisher-dependent concepts. Using properties owl:sameAs and
skos:exactMatch, we found that geographic locations and currencies were frequently
linked at instance level. Otherwise, interlinked resources are quite rare.
4.4

Threats of Validity

We discuss the threats that may influence the validity of our experiments according
to the categories proposed in [14]. Construct validity refers to the extent to which
the experiment setting actually reflects the construct under study. A major threat
is the inability of correctly identifying the Cube datasets in the LOD cloud. We
used the Mannheim Catalogue, the most update collection of linked data. The
extraction procedures also constitute a risk, as we limited the scope of the properties
and resources to be investigated, compared to the original sources. We mitigated
this risk by defining a well-defined set of vocabulary terms and by exploring the
different paths that connect resources, as well as by focusing the analysis solely on
the type of resources extracted. Conclusion validity threats the ability to draw
the correct conclusion about relations between the treatment and the outcome
of an experiment. We assumed the existence of specific modeling strategies, but
eventually others exist. We mitigated this risk by basing our study on the cube
specification and real datasets found in the LOD cloud. The representativeness of
the measures is another concern. As one publisher represented about half of the
datasets and DSDs studied, we mitigated this risk by developing a separate analysis
to detect dominance on the practices regarding this publisher. External validity is
concerned with generalization. We noticed that the vast majority of cube datasets
available were conversions of SDMX data, so the results might be circumstantial.
It can also be argued that some datasets are prior the recommendation of W3,
but we noticed that most people responsible for the actual publication were also
involved in the Cube working group.

Related Work

The 2014 LOD status report [13] revealed the tendency of growth in the number of
statistical datasets and Cube prevalent usage over other vocabularies, and resulted
in the Mannheim Linked Data Catalogue, used in this work. A study [12] examined
different strategies of vocabulary reuse in the LOD cloud, and by far participants
preferred a single, popular vocabulary. However, both standard vocabulary and
standard usages are important.
Different works have addressed the modeling of data using the Cube in case
studies, either from scratch [10,9] or converting existing SDMX data using rather

straightforward conversion rules (e.g. [4]). Our work contributes with feedback
that can make such conversion rules evolve, such that the purposes and benefits of
both LOD and SDMX can be achieved.
LOD2 Statistical Workbench [7], OpenCube [8], Vital [5] and OLAP4LD [9] are
platforms that support using, publishing, validating and visualizing Cube datasets.
The results of this survey can be leveraged to integrate components that also
provide methodological guidance to support modelings choices. An approach for
identifying potentially relevant datasets in the LOD cloud related to seed concepts
was presented in [2], where the diversity of modeling approaches and conceptual
enrichment needs to be taken into account.

Conclusions

In this paper, we discussed common Cube modeling strategies,and their impact
on automatically finding and consuming data. We then developed a quantitative
study to understand current usage of the Cube in the LOD cloud.The analysis
framework uses GQM to translate concerns about acknowledgement of DSD
advantages and reuse, modeling strategies, and conceptual enrichment. The results
establish a baseline for future comparison, and provides input for works on Cube
methodological support, supporting platforms, and cube datasets discovery.
Although outside of the scope of this study, we were surprised by the elevated
number of cubes that are not well-formed. We found cube datasets without a
corresponding DSD, DSDs without measures, dimensions defined without ranges,
among other trivial issues. Existing Cube validators [7] can easily support the
syntactic usage of the vocabulary, but we lack methodological and infrastructure
support for modeling decisions, and translating them in the appropriate Cube
constructs.
The results reveal that most Cube datasets are straightforward conversions of
SDMX data. This type of conversion explores mainly the properties of SDMX as
a standard for exchanging statistical data. It is effective from an interoperability
point of view, but limited with regard to the LOD purposes, in which the focus is
the ability of automatically processing of data. The adoption of underused cube
constructs would introduce more normative ways of modeling multidimensional
data, and explicitly defining in the structure and semantics of DSDs, particularly
with regard to measures and dimensions, as discussed in Section 3.
Publishers are also very concerned with establishing a proper, standard vocabulary which is uniformly applied within the scope of a specific organization. There
is a serious concern with linkage, but currently, it is mainly focused on instances
of specific types (e.g. geographical). Despite dimensions often represent the same
concepts (age, year, frequency), they are hardly integrated across datasets of different domains, nor interlinked. The study points for an opportunity of integrating
commonly used dimensions, either by reuse, adoption of standard concepts, or
concept-based linkage.
Overall, the use of Cube is new, and its usage will reveal the importance of
certain constructs (e.g. non-normalized cubes). Features for modeling aggregated
measures, typical of BI environments, are certainly missing [6].
We are currently using the investigated patterns of Cube usage in an approach
to automatically identify and integrate cube datasets for developing knowledge

discovery applications [2]. The main challenges have been to explore how the
semantics about dimensions and measures are represented in order to match
with seed concepts. In addition, the compatibility of dimension values is key for
integrating indicators distributed in different datasets. Future work includes the
expansion of the survey to explore other aspects such as additional constructs,
linkage and provenance; development of Cube modelling guidelines and methodological support; development of automatic converters for the identified modeling
strategies; formalization of dimension compatibility verification and conversion
algorithms; among others.
