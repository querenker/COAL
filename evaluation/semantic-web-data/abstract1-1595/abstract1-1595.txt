Linked Data technologies are increasingly being implemented to enhance cataloguing workflows in memory institutions such as libraries, archives and museums. These institutions actively seek authoritative Linked Data datasets to enhance their metadata. This talk presents the results of Linked Logainm. Linked
Logainm is a collaborative project that aimed to create a Linked Data dataset
out of Logainm.ie, an online database holding the authoritative hierarchical list
of Irish and English language place names in Ireland. We will describe the process
of generating RDF from XML, elaborate on the discovery and creation of links
with other Linked Data datasets, and report on how the dataset we created
was used to enhance the National Library of Ireland’s metadata MARCXML
metadata records for its Longfield maps collection. We conclude this talk with
describing the potential benefits of Linked Logainm, the applications that can
be built on top of this dataset, and a reflection on the work we have conducted.
