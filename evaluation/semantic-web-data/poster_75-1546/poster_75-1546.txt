Abstract. The Gene Ontology (GO) is a well-established, structured
vocabulary used in the functional annotation of gene products. GO terms
are used to replace the multiple nomenclatures used by scientific databases
that can hamper data integration. Currently, GO consists of more than
41,000 terms describing the molecular function, biological process and
subcellular location of a gene product in a generic cell.
The UniProt-Gene Ontology Annotation (UniProt-GOA) project [1] provides high-quality manual and electronic GO annotations, historically to
proteins within the UniProt Knowledgebase. Recently, support for annotation of RNAs via RNAcentral IDs and to macromolecular complexes,
identified by IntAct Complex Portal IDs, was added. For many species,
no experimental data is available: electronic annotations are the only
source of information for biological investigation, and it is therefore critical that solid pipelines for data integration across multiple resources
be implemented. For example, we rely on Ensembl [2] to project GO
annotations automatically according to orthology between species, or
InterPro [3] to identify proteins with similar signatures to which GO
terms describing the conserved function or location can be associated. In
September 2015, an additional 1.5 million annotations from the UniProt
Unified Rule (UniRule [4]) system were added electronically.
In addition to increasing the number of annotations available, UniProtGOA also supports, as part of manual curation, the addition of information about the context of a GO term, such as the target gene or the
location of a molecular function, via annotations extensions. For example, we can now describe that a gene product is located in a specific
compartment of a specific cell type (e.g., gene product that localizes to
the nucleus of a keratinocyte [5]). Annotation extensions are amenable to
sophisticated queries and reasoning. A typical use case is for researchers
studying a protein that is causative of a specific rare cardiac phenotype:
they will be more interested in specific cardiomyocytes cell differentiation
proteins than all proteins involved in cell differentiation.
Annotation files for various reference proteomes are released monthly, including human, mouse, rat, zebrafish, cow, chicken, dog, pig, Arabidopsis
and Dictyostelium, as well as a file for the multiple species within UniProtKB. The UniProt-GOA dataset can be queried through our user-friendly

QuickGO browser6 or downloaded in a parsable format via the EMBLEBI [7] and GO Consortium FTP [8] sites.
UniProt-GOA is the largest and most comprehensive open-source contributor of annotations to the GO Consortium annotation effort. The
UniProt-GOA dataset has increasingly been integrated into tools that
aid in the analysis of large datasets resulting from high-throughput experiments thus assisting researchers in biological interpretation of their
results.
