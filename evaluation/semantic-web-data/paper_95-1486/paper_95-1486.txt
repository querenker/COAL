Abstract. RDF Stream Processing (RSP) bridges the gap between semantic technologies and data stream systems. Although a number of RSP
systems have been recently proposed, no RDF streams are actually made
publicly available on the Web. To cope with this, RSP engines require
ad-hoc wrappers in order to be fed from non-RDF streams available on
the Internet. In this paper we present TripleWave: an approach for publishing existing streams on the Web as RDF streams, using mappings to
perform live transformation of data, and following the Linked Data principles. We implemented and deployed TripleWave for a concrete use-case:
a live feed of updates of Wikipedia.

Introduction

Data streams are one of the main sources of data on the Web, and are actively
being produced in several domains, ranging from social networks to IoT. A data
stream [1] can be defined as an ordered sequence of items (e, t), where e is a data
item and t is a time annotation. Recently, the notion of RDF stream, where the
data item e is modeled as RDF, has gained prominence. Several RDF stream
Processing (RSP) approaches and systems [8] have been proposed to deal with
this type of data, powering applications in several domains [6] and launching
standardization efforts3 . Surprisingly, public RDF Streams are generally missing
in the landscape of RDF stream processing. In fact, to the best of our knowledge,
there are currently no RDF streams published and publicly available over the
Web. Existing RSP engines have circumvented this issue in different ways: e.g.
the SLD framework has internal components to lift the data in RDF [2], while
SPARQLstream [5] uses the notion of virtual RDF streams. Other engines expose
programmatic APIs and delegate to the users the task to manage the streams
and to feed the system through the APIs [7].
Inspired by the experience of the community in publishing static data sets
as RDF data sets, in this work we present TripleWave, a framework to transform existing streams in RDF streams, and publish them on the Web. Moving

from static to dynamic data poses new requirements not addressed by existing
solutions. In particular, the high velocity on which the data is generated makes
it difficult to to permanently store the whole data stream and to publish it as
Linked Data. To overcome this limit, we extend the initial proposal about publishing RDF streams in [3], defining two types of triple graphs: stream graphs
and instantaneous graphs, as detailed in Section 3. As output, TripleWave produces a JSON stream in the JSON-LD format: each stream element is described
by an RDF graph and the time annotation is modeled as an annotation over
the graph. Using this format compliant with existing standards, TripleWave enables processing RDF streams not only with RSP engines, but also with existing
frameworks and techniques for RDF processing (e.g. SPARQL engines).
As a case study, we consider the change stream of Wikipedia4 . This stream
features all the changes that occur on the Wikipedia website. This stream is
characterized by heterogeneity: it comprehends not only elements related to the
creation or modification of pages (e.g., articles and books), but also events related
to users (new registrations and blocked users), and discussions among them.
{ "page": "Naruto: Ultimate Ninja",
"pageUrl": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto:_Ultimate_Ninja",
"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=669355471&oldid=669215360",
"delta": -7, "comment": "/ Characters /",

Listing 1.1. A fragment of the change stream of Wikipedia

Listing 1.15 shows a fragment of the stream of changes of Wikipedia. In particular, it shows that the user Jmorrison230582 modified an article of the English
Wikipedia about Naruto: Ultimate Ninja. Furthermore, the delta attribute
tell us that the user deleted some words, and the url attribute refers the to the
Wikipedia page that describes the event.

R2RML to create RDF streams

Streams on the Web are available in a myriad of formats, so to adapt and transform them to RDF streams we use a generic transformation process that is specified as R2RML6 mappings. Although these mappings were originally conceived
for relational database inputs, we can use light extensions that support other
formats such as CSV or JSON (e.g. as in RML7 ). The example below specifies
how a Wikipedia stream update can be mapped to a graph of an RDF stream8 .
This mapping defines first a triple that indicates that the generated subject is
of type schema:UpdateAction. The predicateObjectMap clauses add two more

the author of the update. The graph is specified using the graphMap property.
:wikiUpdateMap a rr:TriplesMap; rr:logicalTable :wikistream;
rr:subjectMap [ rr:template "http://131.175.141.249/TripleWave/{time}";
rr:class schema:UpdateAction; rr:graphMap :streamGraph ];
rr:predicateObjectMap [rr:predicate schema:object; rr:objectMap [ rr:column "pageUrl" ]];
rr:predicateObjectMap [rr:predicate schema:agent; rr:objectMap [ rr:column "userUrl"] ];.

Additional mappings can be specified, as in the example below, for providing
more information about the user (e.g. user name):
:wikiUserMap a rr:TriplesMap; rr:logicalTable :wikistream;
rr:subjectMap
[ rr:column "userUrl";
rr:class schema:Person; rr:graphMap :streamGraph ];
rr:predicateObjectMap [ rr:predicate schema:name; rr:objectMap [ rr:column "user" ]];.

A snippet of the resulting RDF Stream graph, serialized in JSON-LD, is
shown in in Listing 1.2.

Publishing stream elements as Linked Data

TripleWave is implemented in Node.js and streams out the RDF stream using
HTTP with chunked transfer encoding. Consumers can register at the endpoint
http://131.175.141.249/TripleWave/wiki.json and receive the data following a push paradigm. In cases where consumers may want to pull the data, TripleWave allows publishing the data accordingly to the Linked Data principles [4].
Given that the stream supplies data that changes very frequently, data is only
temporarily available for consumption, assuming that recent stream elements are
more relevant. In order to allow the consumer to discover which are the currently
available stream elements, we use and extend the framework proposed in [3]. According to this scheme, TripleWave distinguishes between two kinds of Named
Graphs: the Stream Graph (sGraph) and the Instantaneous Graphs (iGraphs).
Intuitively, an iGraph represents one stream element, while the sGraph contains
the descriptions of the iGraphs.
tr:sGraph

sld:contains (tr:1435682699954 tr:1435682699587) ;
sld:lastUpdate "2015-06-29T15:46:05"^^xsd:dateTime .
tr:1435682699587 sld:receivedAt "2015-06-30T16:44:59.587Z"^^xsd:dateTime .
tr:1435682699954 sld:receivedAt "2015-06-30T16:44:59.954Z"^^xsd:dateTime .

Listing 1.3. The sGraph pointing to the iGraph described in Listing 1.2.

As an example, for the Wikipedia RDF stream, the sGraph is published at
the address http://131.175.141.249/TripleWave/sGraph. By accessing the
sGraph, consumers discover which are the stream elements (identified by iGraphs)
available at the current time instants. The sGraph in Listing 1.3 describes the
sGraph and the current content that can be retrieved. The ordered list of iGraphs
is modeled as an rdf:list with the most recent iGraph as the first element, and
with each iGraph having its relative timestamp annotation. Next, the consumer
can access the iGraphs dereferencing the iGraph URL address. As example, when
the consumer accesses the graph9 at http://131.175.141.249/TripleWave/
1435682699587, it retrieves the content of the graph reported in Listing 1.2.

Conclusion

We have presented TripleWave, a system that allows deploying RDF Streams
on the Web, taking existing streams of non-RDF data and converting them to
stream graphs using declarative mappings. TripleWave allows publishing these
streams as Linked Data, as well as a live stream of RDF graphs. We have implemented and deployed a use-case that feeds from a live stream of Wikipedia
updates. This constitutes a first step towards ubiquitous deployment of RDF
streams, based on the ever-increasing amount of data streams available on the
Web and the upcoming Internet of Things. Moreover, the provision of RDF
stream data will prompt new challenges to existing Linked Data solutions, and
will contribute to the maturity of RSP technologies.
